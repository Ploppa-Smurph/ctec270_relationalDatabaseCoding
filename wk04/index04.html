<h2>04 Review Questions</h2>
<b>01) A software development team uses Hibernate as its object-relational mapping (ORM) tool to interact with a database for its web application. The team is facing performance issues with complex queries. 
    Which recommendations should an experienced database administrator provide to optimize the application's performance when working with Hibernate?</b>
    <i>Opt for native SQL queries over HQL for complex queries</i>

<b>02) A business analyst needs to update a report to meet new company requirements. The analyst needs to combine the product name and description fields into a single field, separate them by a colon and space, 
    and display only the first ten characters of the combined field. What function(s) should the SELECT statement include? (Select the two best options.)</b>
    <i>SUBSTRING()
       CONCAT_WS()</i>

<b>03) A toy store tracks the price history of its products. Which trigger type automatically inserts the price and date into a separate table every time a product's price updates in the "Products" table?</b>
    <i>AFTER UPDATE</i>

<b>04) What type of trigger should the company use to automate its customer service process by sending a notification email to the customer service representative (CSR) when a customer leaves a review on its website?</b>
    <i>BEFORE INSERT</i>

<b>05) A database administrator (DBA) working for a university needs to create a stored procedure to update student information in the "Student" table. The procedure should update a student's email and phone number when given the student's ID. 
    Which of the following stored procedures can the DBA use for this task?</b>
    <i>usp_UpdateStudentInfo</i>

<b>06) ABC Inc.'s DBA is evaluating the impact of programming on database operations concerning the efficiency of queries generated by object-relational mapping (ORM) tools. 
    What role can a DBA play in mitigating the negative impact of programming on the efficiency of queries generated by ORM tools in ABC Inc.'s database operations?</b>
    <i>Provide guidance to developers</i>

<b>07) A database administrator needs to provide access to a specific data set in a database without granting access to all the data fields stored in the tables. 
    Which of the following commands will help the administrator create a view of that data?</b>
    <i>CREATE VIEW statement</i>

<b>08) The marketing team of a toy store requires the analysis of the average, maximum, and minimum price of each toy category, as well as the total number of toys in each category. 
    What aggregate functions should the SELECT statement include to accomplish this task?</b>
    <i>These aggregate functions will calculate the total number of toys in each category (COUNT()), the average price (AVG()), the maximum price (MAX()), and the minimum price (MIN()) of toys in each category, which matches the requirements specified by the marketing team.</i>

<b>09) A company has two tables, "Employee" with columns EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, and Department, and "Department" with columns DepartmentID, DepartmentName, and Location. The company wants to create an object in the database that displays the employee details and their respective departments without giving users access to the tables. 
    What should the company create to achieve this?</b>
    <i>View</i>

<b>10) A toy company needs to ensure that the data in its inventory database is always up-to-date with the latest sales information from its physical store and online shop. Which of the following would be the most effective solution to this problem?</b>
    <i>Using a trigger to automatically update the inventory data whenever a sale is made</i>

<b>11) What function type would allow a structured query language (SQL) developer to create a routine that accepts parameters, performs an action, and returns the result of that action as a value?</b>
    <i>User-defined functions</i>

<b>12) A database has an "Employees" table with columns EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Department, and Salary. The database administrator (DBA) wants to create a view that displays each employee's full name and department. 
    Which structured query language (SQL) query should the DBA use to create the required view?</b>
    <i>CREATE VIEW EmployeeNames AS SELECT CONCAT(FirstName, ' ', LastName) AS FullName, Department FROM Employees;</i>

<b>13) A database developer creates a view displaying product information and average rating. The view includes columns for ProductID, ProductName, and AvgRating. Two tables store the necessary data: "Products" and "ProductRatings." 
    The "Products" table has columns ProductID, ProductName, and Price, while the "ProductRatings" table has columns RatingID, ProductID, and Rating. To create the view, which structured query language (SQL) script should the developer use?</b>
    <i>CREATE VIEW ProductAverageRatings AS SELECT p.ProductID, p.ProductName, AVG(r.Rating) AS AvgRating FROM Products p JOIN ProductRatings r ON p.ProductID = r.ProductID GROUP BY p.ProductID, p.ProductName;</i>

<b>14) During peak hours, a company's e-commerce website experiences slow performance. What factors should one consider when evaluating the impact of programming on the database server?</b>
    <i>Review ORM-generated queries for inefficiencies</i>

<b>15) A software development team is building a web application that requires a database solution to store and manage user data. The application includes a feature that calculates and displays the average age of users. 
    As an experienced database administrator, which of the following structured query language (SQL) functions would a database administrator recommend to the development team for calculating the average age of users from a table named "Users" with a column named "Age"?</b>
    <i>AVG()</i>

<b>16) Which of the following is a potential negative impact of using object-relational mapping (ORM) in a database operation?</b>
    <i>Inefficient queries generated by ORM</i>

<b>17) A company has a table called "Orders" with columns OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate, and TotalAmount, and another table called "OrderItems" with columns OrderItemID, OrderID, ProductID, Quantity, and Price. The company wants to create a view that displays the total revenue per product, 
    but don't want the users to see the individual order or customer details. Which structured query language (SQL) query should the company use to create the required view?</b>
    <i>CREATE VIEW ProductRevenue AS SELECT oi.ProductID, SUM(oi.Quantity * oi.Price) AS TotalRevenue FROM Orders o JOIN OrderItems oi ON o.OrderID = oi.OrderID GROUP BY oi.ProductID;</i>

<b>18) What process can a database administrator (DBA) use to determine the impact of programming on the database server when using object-relational mapping (ORM) tools to understand the impact of programming on database operations?</b>
    <i>Monitor database query performance</i>

<b>19) What process can a database administrator (DBA) use to confirm the validity of code generated by object-relational mapping (ORM) tools in the context of understanding the impact of programming on database operations?</b>
    <i>Use an automated code validation tool</i>

<b>20) What function should the SELECT statement include to calculate the number of days remaining until the follow-up date on a report that lists purchase orders and their respective follow-up dates, which should be 30 days after the purchase order date?</b>
